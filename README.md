# cypress-api-zero-project

This project is all about learning api testing using cypress.

## Create a project and Install Cypress
   
  1. Create a empty directory of the project name
  2. Open it in the IDE and open the terminal
  3. Run `npm init`. It will create `package.json`.
  4. Run `npm install cypress`
  5. Rum `npx install open`. It will create some example code and folder structure for you. You can delete the examples and start your own project to work on.Happy coding !

## How to run the tests ?

   1. Start stub server using `npm run stubs`
   2. Run the API tests using `npm cypress:run`
